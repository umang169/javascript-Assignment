//Q 3. Build a feature for Store's Inventory.
//Suppose a store has a list of items and their prices in US Dollars stored as an object. Create a JavaScript
//program to convert the prices to Indian Rupees using an exchange rate of 1 USD to 80 INR. The program should
//use the map higher-order function to create a new object with the converted prices in Rupees.

const store = {"item1" : 10 , "item2" : 20 , "item3":30}
const store_arr = Object.entries(store).map(([key,value])=>console.log(key,value*80))
