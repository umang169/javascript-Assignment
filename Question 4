// Q4. Filtering and Capitalizing: Books Published After 2010 with Author Names.
// Write a program that takes a list of books, including their authors and publication years as input. The program
// should then filter out all books that were published before 2010 and create a new array with the remaining
// books, but with their author names capitalized.

const books = [
  { title: 'Book 1', author: 'author 1', year: 2005 },
  { title: 'Book 2', author: 'author 2', year: 2012 },
  { title: 'Book 3', author: 'author 3', year: 2008 },
  { title: 'Book 4', author: 'author 4', year: 2015 }
];

for(let i=0;i<books.length;i++){
  book = books[i]
  if(book.year>2010){
     book.author=book.author.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + book.author.slice(1)
    console.log(book)
  }
}
