// Q 2. Random Number Generator with Delay and Progress Indication:
// The goal of this program is to generate a random number after a delay of 3 seconds, and store the delay in a
// variable so can be modified. The program displays a message every second indicating the time remaining
// until the random number is generated and then outputs the generated number.

let delay = 3
 x = setInterval(()=>{
  if(delay>0){
    console.log("wait for "+ delay + "sec...")
  delay = delay -1
  }
  else {
    console.log(Math.floor(Math.random()*100))
    clearInterval(x)
    
  }
},1000)
